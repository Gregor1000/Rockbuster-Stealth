# SQLqueries
The data analyst course at Careerfoundry is project based. For learning SQL I did the following project:
# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analyis
## Key Questions
1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What are the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
4. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
## Data
A fictive Excel dataset was used
## Presentation of findings
Findings were presented via a [Powerpoint Presentation](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AuD1Cerkd4TJr5Iu22p8xVYZ5O8qAw?e=sUaK5a).
Most of the graphics were made via [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/RockbusterStealth_16522348297510/TopRevenueperCategory?:language=de-DE&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
