The data analyst course at Careerfoundry is project based. For learning SQL I did the following project:
# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analyis
## Key Questions

#### What are the average rental duration for all videos?
#### Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
#### Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
#### Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
## Data
We used a fictive dataset
## Presentation of findings
#### Findings were presented via a [Powerpoint Presentation](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AuD1Cerkd4TJr5Iu22p8xVYZ5O8qAw?e=sUaK5a)
#### Most of the graphics were made via [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/DI3_10/Sheet9?:language=de-DE&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
